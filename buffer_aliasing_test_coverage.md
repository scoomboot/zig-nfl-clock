# Buffer Aliasing Test Coverage Summary

## Overview
Added comprehensive test coverage for buffer aliasing scenarios in the TimeFormatter module to ensure no memory corruption or panics occur during string formatting operations.

## Tests Added

### 1. Regression Test
**Test Name:** `unit: TimeFormatter: handles buffer aliasing in final minute formatting`
- Tests the exact panic scenario that was fixed where formatTimeWithContext was trying to format into self.buffer using a slice that already pointed to data in the same buffer
- Validates that formatTimeWithContext(45, 2, false) returns "00:45 - Final minute"
- Validates that formatTimeWithContext(30, 4, false) returns "00:30 - Final minute"
- Ensures buffer remains usable after multiple calls

### 2. Edge Cases Test
**Test Name:** `unit: TimeFormatter: handles final minute edge cases correctly`
- Tests 0 seconds in final minute for quarters 2 and 4
- Tests exactly 60 seconds (boundary of final minute)
- Tests 61 seconds (just outside final minute)
- Tests all quarters (1, 2, 3, 4) with various time values
- Validates that only quarters 2 and 4 show "Final minute" annotation

### 3. Stress Test
**Test Name:** `stress: TimeFormatter: no buffer corruption under repeated formatting`
- Calls formatTimeWithContext 1500 times with random valid inputs
- Calls formatGameTime 1000 times with different format types
- Tests formatPlayClock, formatQuarter, and formatTimeouts 500 times each
- Uses deterministic seed (42) for reproducible results
- Validates output patterns for each scenario

### 4. Integration Test
**Test Name:** `integration: TimeFormatter: interaction between formatGameTime and formatTimeWithContext`
- Tests that formatGameTime and formatTimeWithContext work correctly together without buffer issues
- Tests methods in different sequences to ensure no corruption
- Mixes different format types (standard, compact)
- Tests two-minute warning scenario

## Test Results
All 32 tests pass successfully:
- 27 tests in time_formatter.test.zig
- 5 tests in time_formatter.zig
- No memory corruption detected
- No buffer aliasing issues
- All edge cases handled correctly

## Code Location
Tests added to: `/home/fisty/code/zig-nfl-clock/lib/game_clock/utils/time_formatter/time_formatter.test.zig`

## MCS Compliance
All tests follow the Maysara Code Style (MCS) guidelines:
- Proper test naming convention: `test "<category>: <component>: <description>"`
- 4-space indentation within sections
- Categories used: unit, integration, stress
- Component name: TimeFormatter
