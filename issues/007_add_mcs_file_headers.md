# Issue #007: Add MCS file headers

## Summary
Add standardized Maysara Code Style (MCS) file headers to all source files in the library.

## Description
Apply consistent file headers across all `.zig` files following the MCS specification. Headers should include file purpose, repository information, documentation links, and the signature vibe line.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Add headers to main files:
  - [x] `lib/game_clock.zig`
  - [x] `lib/game_clock/game_clock.zig`
  - [x] `lib/game_clock/game_clock.test.zig`
- [x] Add headers to utility modules:
  - [x] `time_formatter/time_formatter.zig`
  - [x] `time_formatter/time_formatter.test.zig`
  - [x] `rules_engine/rules_engine.zig`
  - [x] `rules_engine/rules_engine.test.zig`
  - [x] `play_handler/play_handler.zig`
  - [x] `play_handler/play_handler.test.zig`
- [x] Each header must include:
  - [x] File name and brief description
  - [x] Repository URL
  - [x] Documentation URL (if applicable)
  - [x] Author GitHub profile
  - [x] "Vibe coded by Scoom." signature
- [x] Headers must use consistent formatting:
  - [x] Comment style: `//` for all lines
  - [x] Blank comment line after header
  - [x] Proper spacing and alignment

## Dependencies
- âœ… [#004](004_time_management_module.md): Time Management Module *(Completed via enhancement approach)*
- âœ… [#005](005_rules_engine_module.md): Rules Engine Module *(Completed via enhancement approach)*
- âœ… [#006](006_play_handler_module.md): Play Handler Module *(Completed via enhancement approach)*
- ðŸ”´ [#027](027_fix_test_compilation_errors.md): Utility modules must be functional before headers can be properly added

## Implementation Notes
Template for file headers:
```zig
// game_clock.zig â€” NFL game clock management library
//
// repo   : https://github.com/fisty/zig-nfl-clock
// docs   : https://fisty.github.io/zig-nfl-clock/game_clock
// author : https://github.com/fisty
//
// Vibe coded by Scoom.
```

Adjust the description line for each file:
- Main entry: "NFL game clock management library"
- Core implementation: "Core game clock implementation"
- Tests: "Game clock unit tests"
- Time formatter: "Time display and formatting utilities"
- Rules engine: "NFL clock rules implementation"
- Play handler: "Play outcome processing"

## Testing Requirements
- Verify all files have headers
- Check header format consistency
- Ensure URLs are correct
- Validate comment style

## Reference
- MCS documentation: `/home/fisty/code/zig-nfl-clock/docs/MCS.md`
- Section: File Headers

## Estimated Time

## Resolution Summary

**Completed on**: 2025-08-17

**Changes Made**:
1. Updated all 9 Zig files with proper MCS file headers
2. Corrected author URL from `maysara-elshewehy` to `fisty` across all files
3. Added appropriate descriptions for each file type:
   - Main library files: Clear purpose descriptions
   - Test files: Specified as unit tests for their respective modules
   - Utility modules: Described their specific functionality
4. Verified all headers include:
   - Correct repository URL: `https://github.com/zig-nfl-clock`
   - Proper documentation paths
   - Author profile: `https://github.com/fisty`
   - "Vibe coded by Scoom." signature line

**Files Modified**: 9 files
- `lib/game_clock.zig`
- `lib/game_clock/game_clock.zig`
- `lib/game_clock/game_clock.test.zig`
- `lib/game_clock/utils/time_formatter/time_formatter.zig`
- `lib/game_clock/utils/time_formatter/time_formatter.test.zig`
- `lib/game_clock/utils/rules_engine/rules_engine.zig`
- `lib/game_clock/utils/rules_engine/rules_engine.test.zig`
- `lib/game_clock/utils/play_handler/play_handler.zig`
- `lib/game_clock/utils/play_handler/play_handler.test.zig`

**Verification**: All files now have 100% MCS-compliant headers with consistent formatting
