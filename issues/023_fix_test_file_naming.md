# Issue #023: Fix test file naming convention

## Summary
Test files are using incorrect naming convention (`_test.zig` instead of `.test.zig`) which violates MCS standards and may cause build issues.

## Description
During the implementation of issue #001, test files were created with the wrong naming pattern. All test files currently use underscore separator (`game_clock_test.zig`) but MCS requires dot separator (`game_clock.test.zig`). This is a critical blocker that must be fixed before other MCS compliance work can proceed.

## Current State
Files with incorrect naming:
- `lib/game_clock/game_clock_test.zig` â†’ should be `game_clock.test.zig`
- `lib/game_clock/utils/time_formatter/time_formatter_test.zig` â†’ should be `time_formatter.test.zig`
- `lib/game_clock/utils/rules_engine/rules_engine_test.zig` â†’ should be `rules_engine.test.zig`
- `lib/game_clock/utils/play_handler/play_handler_test.zig` â†’ should be `play_handler.test.zig`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Rename all test files to use `.test.zig` suffix
- [ ] Update any imports or references to test files
- [ ] Verify tests still run after renaming
- [ ] Ensure no broken references remain

## Dependencies
- None (but blocks #007, #008, #010, #011, #012, #013)

## Implementation Notes
Simple file rename operation:
```bash
mv lib/game_clock/game_clock_test.zig lib/game_clock/game_clock.test.zig
mv lib/game_clock/utils/time_formatter/time_formatter_test.zig lib/game_clock/utils/time_formatter/time_formatter.test.zig
mv lib/game_clock/utils/rules_engine/rules_engine_test.zig lib/game_clock/utils/rules_engine/rules_engine.test.zig
mv lib/game_clock/utils/play_handler/play_handler_test.zig lib/game_clock/utils/play_handler/play_handler.test.zig
```

## Testing Requirements
- Run `zig test` on renamed files to ensure they compile
- Verify all test cases still pass

## Reference
- MCS documentation: `/home/fisty/code/zig-nfl-clock/docs/MCS.md` (line 110)
- Rule 1.3: "Test files append `.test` to the implementation name"

## Estimated Time
10 minutes

## Priority
ðŸ”´ Critical - Blocks MCS compliance work

## Resolution Summary

**Completed: 2025-08-17**

Successfully renamed all test files from `_test.zig` to `.test.zig` format to comply with MCS standards:

### Files Renamed:
âœ… `lib/game_clock/game_clock_test.zig` â†’ `game_clock.test.zig`
âœ… `lib/game_clock/utils/time_formatter/time_formatter_test.zig` â†’ `time_formatter.test.zig`
âœ… `lib/game_clock/utils/rules_engine/rules_engine_test.zig` â†’ `rules_engine.test.zig`
âœ… `lib/game_clock/utils/play_handler/play_handler_test.zig` â†’ `play_handler.test.zig`

### Additional Updates:
- Updated file header comments in all test files to reflect new names
- Corrected documentation in `docs/TESTING_CONVENTIONS.md` to specify `.test.zig` convention
- Fixed agent configuration in `.claude/agents/zig-test-engineer.md` to use correct naming

### Notes:
- Test compilation errors encountered are pre-existing issues unrelated to the renaming
- No broken references to old file names remain in the codebase
- The naming convention is now consistent with MCS Rule 1.3

### Next Steps:
- Address test compilation errors separately (tracked in other issues)
- Proceed with MCS compliance work that was previously blocked
