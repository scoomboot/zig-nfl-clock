# Issue #026: Reconcile existing implementation with planned issues

## Summary
Issues #002-#006 describe extracting functionality from nfl-sim, but issue #001 already implemented most of this functionality from scratch.

## Description
During the resolution of issue #001, a complete NFL game clock implementation was created from scratch, including core types, time management, rules engine, and play handler modules. This implementation may differ from what's in nfl-sim and makes issues #002-#006 partially or fully redundant. We need to reconcile what's been built with what was planned.

## Current State
Already implemented in issue #001:
- **Core Types**: Quarter enum, GameState enum, GameClockError
- **GameClock struct**: Complete implementation with all core functionality
- **Time Management**: Formatting utilities with multiple display options
- **Rules Engine**: NFL timing rules, two-minute warning, timeout management
- **Play Handler**: Play outcome processing, statistics tracking

Not yet implemented (mentioned in issues #002-#006):
- ClockState enum (Stopped, Running, Expired)
- PlayClockState enum (Active, Inactive, Warning)
- PlayClockDuration enum (Normal40, Short25)
- ClockStoppingReason enum
- ClockSpeed enum (simulation speeds)
- Integration with existing nfl-sim code

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Review implementation from issue #001 against requirements in #002-#006
- [ ] Identify gaps between current implementation and planned features
- [ ] Determine if issues #002-#006 should be:
  - Closed as completed
  - Modified to reflect remaining work
  - Replaced with new issues for missing features
- [ ] Document decision and update issue tracker accordingly

## Dependencies
- None

## Implementation Notes
Key differences to evaluate:
1. **Source**: Current implementation is from scratch, not extracted from nfl-sim
2. **Simulation Features**: ClockSpeed enum suggests simulation features that may not belong in a pure clock library
3. **Completeness**: Current implementation may be missing some edge cases from nfl-sim
4. **Code Style**: Current implementation already attempts MCS compliance (with noted violations)

Options:
1. Keep current implementation and close/modify issues #002-#006
2. Extract and merge features from nfl-sim as originally planned
3. Hybrid approach: Keep current code but add missing features from nfl-sim

## Testing Requirements
- Compare functionality between current implementation and nfl-sim
- Ensure no regression in clock behavior
- Validate all NFL rules are properly implemented

## Estimated Time
1 hour

## Priority
ðŸ”´ Critical - Blocks progress on remaining issues
