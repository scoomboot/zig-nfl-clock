# Issue #030: Project Housekeeping

## Summary
Clean up temporary files, commit important configuration files, and fix git tracking issues.

## Description
During the MCS compliance work (issues #007-#009), several temporary report files were created and some important files remain uncommitted. Additionally, build cache files are being tracked in git when they shouldn't be.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Remove temporary report files:
  - [ ] `DOCUMENTATION_REPORT.md`
  - [ ] `MCS_COMPLIANCE_FIX.md`
  - [ ] `MCS_TEST_COMPLIANCE_REPORT.md`
  - [ ] `buffer_aliasing_test_coverage.md`
- [ ] Commit important files:
  - [ ] `.gitignore`
  - [ ] `CLAUDE.md`
- [ ] Fix git tracking:
  - [ ] Remove `.zig-cache/` from git tracking
  - [ ] Ensure future cache files won't be tracked
- [ ] Update documentation:
  - [ ] Update `issues/000_index.md` to reflect completed issues #007-#009

## Dependencies
- None - can be done independently

## Implementation Notes
1. **Temporary Files**: These report files were created during MCS compliance work and served their purpose. They can be safely removed.

2. **Git Cache Issue**: 
   ```bash
   git rm -r --cached .zig-cache/
   git commit -m "Remove build cache from tracking"
   ```

3. **Important Files**: The `.gitignore` and `CLAUDE.md` files are properly configured and should be committed to the repository.

## Testing Requirements
- Verify `.zig-cache/` is no longer tracked
- Verify new build cache files aren't added to git
- Ensure all important project files are committed

## Reference
- Session work on issues #007, #008, #009
- Git best practices for Zig projects

## Estimated Time
