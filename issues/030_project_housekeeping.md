# Issue #030: Project Housekeeping

## Summary
Clean up temporary files, commit important configuration files, and fix git tracking issues.

## Description
During the MCS compliance work (issues #007-#009), several temporary report files were created and some important files remain uncommitted. Additionally, build cache files are being tracked in git when they shouldn't be.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Remove temporary report files:
  - [x] `DOCUMENTATION_REPORT.md`
  - [x] `MCS_COMPLIANCE_FIX.md`
  - [x] `MCS_TEST_COMPLIANCE_REPORT.md`
  - [x] `buffer_aliasing_test_coverage.md`
- [x] Commit important files:
  - [x] `.gitignore`
  - [x] `CLAUDE.md`
- [x] Fix git tracking:
  - [x] Remove `.zig-cache/` from git tracking
  - [x] Ensure future cache files won't be tracked
- [x] Update documentation:
  - [x] Update `issues/000_index.md` to reflect completed issues #007-#009

## Dependencies
- None - can be done independently

## Implementation Notes
1. **Temporary Files**: These report files were created during MCS compliance work and served their purpose. They can be safely removed.

2. **Git Cache Issue**: 
   ```bash
   git rm -r --cached .zig-cache/
   git commit -m "Remove build cache from tracking"
   ```

3. **Important Files**: The `.gitignore` and `CLAUDE.md` files are properly configured and should be committed to the repository.

## Testing Requirements
- Verify `.zig-cache/` is no longer tracked
- Verify new build cache files aren't added to git
- Ensure all important project files are committed

## Reference
- Session work on issues #007, #008, #009
- Git best practices for Zig projects

## Estimated Time
15 minutes

## Resolution Summary

Successfully completed all housekeeping tasks:

1. **Removed temporary report files** - All 4 temporary report files created during MCS compliance work have been deleted
2. **Removed build artifacts** - Cleaned up `libplay_handler.a` and `libplay_handler.a.o` that shouldn't be tracked
3. **Verified git tracking** - Confirmed `.gitignore` and `CLAUDE.md` are properly committed (they were already tracked)
4. **Confirmed .zig-cache exclusion** - Verified `.zig-cache/` is properly ignored and not tracked by git
5. **Updated documentation** - Updated `issues/000_index.md` to reflect this issue as completed

The repository is now clean with no unnecessary files or tracking issues.
