# Issue #034: Fix non-deterministic play type handling and test failures

## Summary
Play processing functions incorrectly modify play types and use unseeded randomness, causing tests to fail unpredictably.

## Description
Multiple tests are failing because the play processing logic in PlayHandler has two critical issues:
1. The `processPassPlay()` function hardcodes the play type as `.pass_short` regardless of the actual play type passed in
2. Random number generation without seed control causes non-deterministic behavior in tests (e.g., 3% chance of converting incomplete passes to interceptions)

## Problems Identified

### 1. Hardcoded Play Type in processPassPlay()
- **Issue**: Function always sets `result.play_type = .pass_short` on line 437
- **Location**: `lib/game_clock/utils/play_handler/play_handler.zig:437`
- **Impact**: All pass plays (medium, deep, screen) are incorrectly reported as short passes
- **Test failures**:
  - `unit: game_clock: play processing` - expects pass_short, gets interception
  - `unit: GameClock: processPlay basic functionality` - same issue
  - `integration: GameClock: processPlay API examples` - same issue
  - `stress: PlayHandler: handles all play types` - expects pass_medium, gets pass_short

### 2. Non-deterministic Interception Logic
- **Issue**: 3% random chance of interceptions on incomplete passes
- **Location**: `lib/game_clock/utils/play_handler/play_handler.zig:477-479`
- **Impact**: Tests expecting specific play types randomly get interceptions
- **Symptom**: Tests pass/fail randomly on different runs

### 3. Similar Issues in Other Play Processing Functions
- **processRunPlay()**: Likely has similar hardcoded play type issue
- **processTurnover()**: May not preserve original turnover type
- **Other play processing functions**: Need audit for similar problems

### 4. Missing Test Seed Control
- **Issue**: RNG is initialized with timestamp, not controlled seed
- **Location**: `PlayHandler.init()` and `PlayHandler.initWithState()`
- **Impact**: Tests cannot be made deterministic

## Test Evidence
```bash
error: 'play processing' failed: expected PlayType.pass_short, found PlayType.interception
error: 'processPlay basic functionality' failed: expected PlayType.pass_short, found PlayType.interception  
error: 'handles all play types' failed: expected PlayType.pass_medium, found PlayType.pass_short
error: 'comprehensive validation' failed: expected PlayType.run_up_middle, found PlayType.fumble
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Fix `processPassPlay()` to preserve the original play type
- [ ] Fix `processRunPlay()` to preserve the original play type
- [ ] Add parameter to control play type in helper functions
- [ ] Add seed parameter to PlayHandler for deterministic testing
- [ ] Make interception/fumble logic optional or controllable for tests
- [ ] All play type tests should pass consistently
- [ ] Tests should be deterministic (same result every run)

## Implementation Notes

### Recommended approach:
1. **Add play_type parameter to processing functions**:
   ```zig
   fn processPassPlay(self: *PlayHandler, play_type: PlayType, target_yards: i16, completion_pct: u8) PlayResult {
       var result = PlayResult{
           .play_type = play_type,  // Use passed-in type, not hardcoded
           // ...
       };
   ```

2. **Add test mode or seed control**:
   ```zig
   pub fn initWithSeed(seed: u64) PlayHandler {
       return .{
           .rng = std.Random.DefaultPrng.init(seed),
           // ...
       };
   }
   ```

3. **Make random events controllable**:
   ```zig
   pub const PlayOptions = struct {
       enable_turnovers: bool = true,
       turnover_chance: u8 = 3,
   };
   ```

### Testing approach:
```bash
# Run tests multiple times to verify determinism
for i in {1..10}; do
    zig build test 2>&1 | grep "play processing"
done

# All runs should have identical results
```

## Dependencies
- Affects: All tests that use `processPlay()` or PlayHandler
- Related to: General test reliability and CI/CD stability

## Estimated Time
30 minutes

## Priority
ðŸ”´ High - Causes non-deterministic test failures, blocks reliable CI/CD
