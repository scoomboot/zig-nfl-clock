# Issue #037: Add missing LICENSE file

## Summary
Create the LICENSE file that is referenced in README.md and build.zig.zon but doesn't exist.

## Description
The project references a LICENSE file in multiple places but the file is missing from the repository. This is a critical issue for open source distribution as it leaves the legal status of the code unclear. The README states the project uses the MIT License.

## Current State
- README.md references LICENSE file in badge and license section
- build.zig.zon includes "LICENSE" in the paths array
- No LICENSE file exists in the repository root

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create LICENSE file in repository root
- [ ] Use standard MIT License text
- [ ] Include copyright year (2025) and author information
- [ ] Verify file is properly tracked in git
- [ ] Ensure build.zig.zon paths array is accurate

## Implementation Notes
Standard MIT License template:
