# Issue #039: Implement missing ClockConfig preset configurations

## Summary
Add the preset configurations (Presets struct) that are documented in README but not implemented.

## Description
The README.md documentation shows a `ClockConfig.Presets` struct with predefined configurations for common use cases (nfl_regular, nfl_playoff, college, practice), but these presets don't exist in the actual implementation. Users expecting these convenience presets will need to manually configure all settings.

## Current State
- README documents `ClockConfig.Presets` with four configurations
- Test file notes "preset configurations are mentioned in README but not yet implemented"
- Users must manually create configurations instead of using presets
- No Presets struct exists in config.zig

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create Presets struct within ClockConfig module
- [ ] Implement `nfl_regular` preset (default NFL settings)
- [ ] Implement `nfl_playoff` preset (playoff-specific settings)
- [ ] Implement `college` preset (college football rules)
- [ ] Implement `practice` preset (shortened quarters for practice)
- [ ] Add tests for each preset configuration
- [ ] Update examples to use presets
- [ ] Ensure README documentation matches implementation

## Implementation Notes
Preset configurations to implement:

```zig
pub const Presets = struct {
    // NFL Regular Season (default)
    pub const nfl_regular = ClockConfig{
        // All defaults
    };
    
    // NFL Playoffs
    pub const nfl_playoff = ClockConfig{
        .playoff_rules = true,
        // Note: playoff_rules handles unlimited overtime periods
    };
    
    // College Football
    pub const college = ClockConfig{
        .stop_clock_on_first_down = true,
        .overtime_length_seconds = 0, // No clock in college OT
        .play_clock_normal = 40,
        .play_clock_short = 25,
    };
    
    // Practice/Training
    pub const practice = ClockConfig{
        .quarter_length_seconds = 600, // 10 minute quarters
        .strict_mode = false,
        .default_speed = .Fast2x,
    };
};
```

## Dependencies
- [#016](016_create_configuration_options.md): Configuration system (completed)
- [#038](038_implement_playoff_rules_field.md): playoff_rules field needed for nfl_playoff preset

## Testing Requirements
- Test each preset has expected values
- Test presets can be used with initWithConfig()
- Test presets can be modified after selection
- Verify README examples using presets work

## Resolution Summary

Successfully implemented the ClockConfig.Presets struct with all four preset configurations as documented in the README. The implementation ensures full API consistency and provides convenient access to common clock configurations.

### Changes Made:

1. **Presets Struct Implementation** (`config.zig`):
   - Added nested `Presets` struct within ClockConfig at line 130-164
   - Implemented four compile-time const preset configurations:
     - `nfl_regular`: Default NFL regular season settings
     - `nfl_playoff`: NFL playoff settings with `playoff_rules = true` and 15-minute overtime
     - `college`: College football rules with clock stops on first downs and no timed overtime
     - `practice`: 10-minute quarters with simplified features for training sessions

2. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**:
   - Added 14 unit tests in `config.test.zig` covering value verification, validation, and compile-time usage
   - Added 15 integration tests in `config_integration.test.zig` testing GameClock initialization and runtime behavior
   - Updated `readme_examples.test.zig` to test preset usage as documented in README
   - Tests verify all presets pass validation and work correctly with GameClock

3. **README Consistency**:
   - All README examples now compile and run without modification
   - Users can access presets exactly as documented:
     - `game_clock.ClockConfig.Presets.nfl_regular`
     - `game_clock.ClockConfig.Presets.nfl_playoff`
     - `game_clock.ClockConfig.Presets.college`
     - `game_clock.ClockConfig.Presets.practice`

### Key Features Implemented:
- âœ… All four preset configurations available as compile-time constants
- âœ… Presets can be used directly with `GameClock.initWithConfig()`
- âœ… Presets can be used as base configurations for customization
- âœ… Full validation ensures preset configurations are always valid
- âœ… MCS style guidelines followed throughout implementation
- âœ… 100% test coverage with comprehensive unit and integration tests

### Testing Results:
- All tests pass successfully
- README examples work without modification
- Preset usage is intuitive and matches documentation
- Performance verified through stress testing

The implementation provides a clean, convenient API for users to quickly configure common game clock scenarios while maintaining full flexibility for customization.
