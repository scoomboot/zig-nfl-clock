# Issue #042: Fix readme_examples.test.zig compilation errors

## Summary
The readme_examples.test.zig file has compilation errors preventing it from building and running, which blocks verification of README code examples.

## Description
The test file that verifies README code examples contains multiple compilation errors that prevent it from building. This means we cannot automatically verify that the code examples in our README are correct and functional.

## Current State
Running `zig test lib/game_clock/readme_examples.test.zig` produces the following errors:

1. **Line 519**: `error: use of undeclared identifier 'Quarter'`
   - Uses `Quarter.Overtime` without importing or qualifying it
   - Should be `game_clock.Quarter.Overtime`

2. **Line 300**: `error: no field named 'quarter_length_seconds' in struct`
   - Uses incorrect field name `quarter_length_seconds`
   - Should be `quarter_length` (as per actual implementation)

These errors prevent the test file from compiling, meaning:
- Cannot verify README examples work correctly
- Cannot catch breaking changes to documented API
- CI/CD cannot include README validation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Fix missing import/qualification for `Quarter` enum on line 519
- [ ] Fix field name from `quarter_length_seconds` to `quarter_length` on line 300
- [ ] Ensure all tests in readme_examples.test.zig compile successfully
- [ ] Verify tests pass when run with `zig build test`
- [ ] No compilation warnings or errors

## Implementation Notes
Required fixes:

```zig
// Line 519 - Change from:
try testing.expectEqual(Quarter.Overtime, clock.quarter);
// To:
try testing.expectEqual(game_clock.Quarter.Overtime, clock.quarter);

// Line 300 - Change from:
try testing.expectEqual(@as(u32, 900), default_config.quarter_length_seconds);
// To:
try testing.expectEqual(@as(u32, 900), default_config.quarter_length);
```

## Dependencies
- Related to Issue #041 (field naming inconsistencies)
- Blocks verification of Issue #039 (config presets) examples
- Required for comprehensive test coverage

## Testing Requirements
- Run `zig build test` to ensure all tests pass
- Verify each README example test case runs successfully
- Check no regressions in other test files

## Root Cause
These errors were introduced when:
1. README documentation used different field names than implementation
2. Test file was written to match README instead of actual API
3. Missing proper imports/qualifications for types

## References
- [readme_examples.test.zig](/home/fisty/code/zig-nfl-clock/lib/game_clock/readme_examples.test.zig) - Lines 300, 519
- [config.zig](/home/fisty/code/zig-nfl-clock/lib/game_clock/utils/config/config.zig) - Correct field names
- [game_clock.zig](/home/fisty/code/zig-nfl-clock/lib/game_clock/game_clock.zig) - Quarter enum definition

## Estimated Time
15 minutes

## Priority
ðŸŸ¡ Medium - Blocks test verification but doesn't affect library functionality

## Category
Test Fix

## Discovery Context
Found during session review when attempting to run readme examples tests. Compilation errors prevent verification of documentation accuracy.
