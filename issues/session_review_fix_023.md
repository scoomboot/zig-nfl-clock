# Session Review - Fix Issue #023

## Session Summary
Successfully resolved issue #023 by renaming all test files from `_test.zig` to `.test.zig` format to comply with MCS standards. Discovered critical test compilation errors that require immediate attention.

## Key Accomplishments
1. ✅ Renamed 4 test files to use `.test.zig` suffix:
   - `game_clock_test.zig` → `game_clock.test.zig`
   - `time_formatter_test.zig` → `time_formatter.test.zig`
   - `rules_engine_test.zig` → `rules_engine.test.zig`
   - `play_handler_test.zig` → `play_handler.test.zig`

2. ✅ Updated file header comments in all test files

3. ✅ Corrected documentation:
   - Fixed `docs/TESTING_CONVENTIONS.md` to specify `.test.zig` convention
   - Updated `.claude/agents/zig-test-engineer.md` with correct naming

4. ✅ Verified no broken references remain in codebase

## Critical Issue Discovered

### Test Compilation Failures (Issue #027 - Filed)
**Impact**: Tests cannot run, blocking all quality assurance
**Discovery**: When attempting to verify tests after renaming
**Problem**: Major API mismatch between test expectations and implementations:
- ~30+ missing methods across all modules
- Type mismatches in error handling
- Const-correctness violations
- Enum type incompatibilities

This is a **genuine blocker** that prevents any testing from occurring. The issue offers clear value as it must be resolved before the library can be validated or maintained.

## Issues Not Filed (Over-Engineering)
None identified - the discovered issue is a critical blocker with immediate impact.

## Value Assessment
- **Issue #023 Resolution**: ✅ High value - removed MCS compliance blocker
- **Issue #027 Discovery**: ✅ Critical value - identified test infrastructure failure
- **Documentation Updates**: ✅ Necessary - maintains consistency

## Metrics
- **Files Modified**: 8 (4 test files, 4 documentation/config files)
- **Broken References Fixed**: 17 occurrences across codebase
- **New Critical Issues**: 1 (#027 - test compilation)
- **Time to Complete**: ~15 minutes

## Conclusion
The session successfully resolved the test naming convention issue but uncovered a more serious problem: the entire test suite is non-functional due to API mismatches. Issue #027 represents a critical blocker that must be addressed before any further testing or quality assurance work can proceed.
