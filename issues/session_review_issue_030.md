# Session Review: Issue #030 Resolution

## Date
2025-08-17

## Session Objective
Complete Issue #030: Project Housekeeping

## Actions Taken
1. Removed 4 temporary report files from MCS compliance work
2. Removed 2 build artifacts (`libplay_handler.a`, `libplay_handler.a.o`)
3. Verified `.gitignore` and `CLAUDE.md` are properly committed
4. Updated issue tracking documentation

## Analysis Results

### Project State Verification
- ✅ All tests passing (`zig build test`)
- ✅ MCS compliance maintained at 100%
- ✅ Git tracking properly configured
- ✅ Build configuration correct (outputs to `zig-out/`)

### Issues Identified
**None** - No genuinely impactful issues or optimization opportunities found.

### Minor Observations
- Build artifacts were found in root directory (likely from manual compilation)
  - Already addressed by removal
  - Already prevented by `.gitignore` configuration
  - Not indicative of any systemic issue

## Conclusion
Routine housekeeping completed successfully. Project remains in good state with no new issues requiring tracking.

## Next Steps
Continue with remaining planned work:
- Phase 3: Testing improvements (#010-#013)
- Phase 4: API & Configuration (#014-#016)
- Phase 5: Documentation (#017-#019)
